**Aim**

To introduce multiple sequence alignment and the inference of evolutionary history. You will learn how to align homologous virus sequence data and construct a phylogenetic tree, use some different methods and how to test the reliability of clades in your phylogeny. 


**Task**

To generate the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1A of the paper [Iyer et al. 2017, Resistance to type 1 interferons is a major determinant of HIV-1 transmission fitness. PNAS 114(4):E590-E599](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620144114#fig01).  

To complete your analysis the key stages to consider are 1/ sequence alignment, 2/ the tree inference method and model choice, 3/ tree visualization and 4/ checking the reliability of clustering with bootstrapping.

**Data**

The data set from the Iyer paper is quite large (available at /home4/VBG_data/Phylogenetics on Alpha) so will take some time to align. To speed things up you can use the pre-processed fasta file with fewer sequences (95) from the linked patients CH595 and CH455 that were presented in their figure 1. **Copy files to your own directory.**

**Software**

Try using the alignment software Mafft or Muscle (type 'mafft filename.fst > filename-mafft-aln' or ‘muscle -align filename.fst -output filename-muscle.aln’ on the command line on the bioinformatics server Alpha2 <alpha2.cvr.gla.ac.uk). The authors used older software, CLUSTALW (commmand ‘clustalw2’ on the command line), have a go using that. Alignments, tree methods and visualization can also be carried out with graphical user interface software, for example, SeaView (command: ‘/software/seaview-v5.0.5/seaview’) or UGENE (‘ugene’). 

To infer a phylogenetic tree try using the popular software IQ-TREE (command: 'iqtree2 -s filename.ph -m HKY -threads-max 1'). Reflect on the lecture at the beginning of the class to choose appropriate parameters. Now try the software RaXML (command: 'raxml-ng-mpi --threads 1 --model HKY --msa filename.fst'). What are the different options doing? To use PhyML for tree inference, type ‘phyml’ on the command line (or available online at http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/). See PhyML’s online helpfile for further guidance on options: http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/usersguide.php. Note, PhyML takes PHYLIP formatted alignments which can be generated with CLUSTALW (or use the .ph file in the Data folder). 

FigTree (command: ‘figtree’) is useful for visualizing phylogenetic trees and highlighting specific variants. 


Once you’ve generated some trees answer the questions below:

**Question 1**. Why is it important to be confident the data you're analysing is homologous before starting a phylogenetic analysis? Do the sequences being homologous guarantee a meaningful analysis? 

**Question 2**. What can you infer from your evolutionary tree about the relationship of virus from the two individuals: CH596 and CH455? What two properties of the phylogenetic tree support this relationship?

**Question 3**. Iyer et al. used the methods: *Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW, with ambiguous regions removed. Maximum likelihood trees with bootstrap support (1,000 replicates) were constructed using PhyML.*  Does this change the results in any meaningful way? Does using a different alignment method matter, e.g., MUSCLE, MAFFT versus CLUSTAL versions? 

**Question 4**. What is the main differences between the maximum likelihood methods and the distance-method neighbor joining (e.g., available in CLUSTALW or SeaView)? 

**Question 5**. Why is PhyML, despite being a maximum likelihood method, relatively quick? What improvement is using the software RAxML or IQ-TREE bring to the analysis?

**Question 6**. Why does the substitution model used matter? What does the software jModelTest used in the Iyer paper do?

**Question 7**. Briefly explaining what bootstrapping is doing. How does it contribute to the analysis? 

**Question 8**. Bonus question! Why should you be concerned about recombination when doing a phylogenetic analysis with virus data? Make a suggestion for some software to use.
